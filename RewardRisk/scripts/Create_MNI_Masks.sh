#	### The script is intended to be used with  FSL standard 2mm MNI brain  ###

#				####    Step 1   ####
# 	This script pulls MNI coordinates provided from .csv input file (field $1) and converts those coordinates into voxel coordinates. The voxel coordinate space calculations are verified using multiple online calculations from matlab and bash codes. To confirm their accuracy, MNI to Voxel coordinate convertion were tested and validated using FSLEYES. 

#						**Caveat**
# Under certain conditions, the voxel coordinate output will deviate by 0.5-1.0, as some conversions from MNI to voxel coordinates will deviate by a fraction. Since FSLEYES rounds, this may appear as a mismatch. However, for the bulk of the MNI <--> vox coordinate values, there is a 1-to-1 match between the script output and the information in fsleyes when viewing a point on an MNI standard 2mm brain


# 				#### Step 2 - 4 ####
# Once MNI coordinates are converted into voxel coordinates, they are saved into a file. Subsequently, there are using in a multi-step process to create ROI's. The steps used in this script are from Andrew Jahn [Blog post: May 2, 2017 -- https://www.andysbrainblog.com/andysbrainblog/2017/5/2/fmri-lab-roi-analysis-in-fsl ]
